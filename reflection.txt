was introduced?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    having easy access history of the file can help me make efficient programer since i can get my old version whenever 
	i want if some chnages which i made were uneccessory 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    commiting automatically will unceccesory create more versions of file and more complicated to work on compare to commiting manually.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    makes much easier to identify changes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can check the different versions of files using git log compare each files...using git diff and can find out changes...

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    yes, since i know that I can go back and forward anytieme to correct my errors.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    i would like git for creating my website.
